## The new address form

To allow the customer to add a new `customer_address`, we can build an `Add new address` form, using the following components:

- `BillingAddressForm`
- `AddressInput`
- `AddressCountrySelector`
- `AddressStateSelector`
- `SaveAddressesButton`.

<span title="Core API" type="info">
  The form will create a new resource `address` and a new `customer_address` relationship with the `customer` resource.

  To better understand the logic behind the form, be sure to be familiar with the following resources:
  - [Customers](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/customers/object)
  - [Addresses](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/addresses/object)
  - [Customer Addresses](https://docs.commercelayer.io/core/v/api-reference/customer_addresses/object)
</span>

The `BillingAddressForm` component is demanded to setup the form related provider and context, enabling children components to interact with them.
<span title="Requirements" type="warning">
  It needs to be wrapped inside an `<AddressesContainer>` component so it will know where to save the address data.

  This means the our form will be structured as follows:
  <Source dark code={`
  <CommerceLayer accessToken='customer-orders-access-token'>
    <CustomerContainer>
      <AddressesContainer>
        <BillingAddressForm>
          // ...fields
        </BillingAddressForm>
        <SaveAddressesButton />
      </AddressesContainer>
    <CustomerContainer />
  </CommerceLayer>
    `} language='jsx' /> 
</span>

For each address field that needs to be saved there will be a form field component along with its related `Errors` block.

To render the field inputs we will use the following components: `AddressInput`, `AddressCountrySelector` and `AddressStateSelector`

### Code implementation
The following block of code implements all the components described above and is ready to be used in your project.

Every time submit the form, a new `address` will be created and listed in the recap underneath (the `<Address>` component).

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />


<span title="The &lt;Errors&gt; component" type="info">
  As you might notice, every input has a correspondant `Errors` component that is used to print validation error during form submition.

  This component is tied up to a specific resource and field, so it will print the error only if the field is invalid, for that specific resource.

  For example `<Errors resource='billing_address' field='billing_address_phone' />` will print the error messages only if the `billing_address_phone` field is invalid.
  <br /> 
  It's possibile to customize/localize the error message by passing a `messages` prop to the component, as the following example shows:

  <Source dark code={`
  <Errors
    resource='billing_address'
    field='billing_address_phone'
    messages={[
      {
        code: 'EMPTY_ERROR',
        resource: 'billing_address',
        field: 'billing_address_phone',
        message: 'Cannot be blank'
      },
      {
        code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
        resource: 'billing_address',
        field: 'billing_address_phone',
        message: 'Must be valid email'
      }
    ]}
  />
  `} language='jsx' />

  This logic is applied to all fields that need to be validated, for both `EMPTY_ERROR` and `VALIDATION_ERROR` code.
  <br />
  <strong>
  To simplify the example above, we omitted the `messages` prop, but you can just copy the example above and implement it for every field.
  </strong>
